# commen.tk
A very simple widget that uses Github issues and their comments to provide any page with a comment section linked with Github.

## Usage
 * Go to [commen.tk](https://commen.tk/)
 * Generate the script tag you want with the form below.
 * Paste it wherever you want the widget to appear in your webpage.
 * The form below will only show public repos but feel free to use private repos as well.
 * However, when using a private repo no comments will load without signing in with an autorized account.

```html
<script type='text/javascript'
    src='https://api.commen.tk/client.js'
    repo='plaguera/commen.tk/1'
    theme='dark'
    page-size='10'
    async
></script>
```
